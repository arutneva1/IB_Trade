"""Compute portfolio level exposure and cash balances.

This module provides a small helper used throughout the tests to reason about
an account's current state.  The real project contains a much richer
implementation but for the exercises we only need a subset of the behaviour:

* Derive per-symbol market values and weights from position quantities and
  prices.
* Report gross and net exposure relative to available equity.
* Track cash balances for USD and CAD while supporting a configurable USD cash
  buffer which is excluded from the exposure calculations.

Only USD denominated assets participate in exposure and weight calculations; an
optional CAD cash balance is carried through verbatim but ignored when
normalising weights.  The return type intentionally mirrors a tiny portion of
the production system making it convenient for unit tests to assert on specific
figures.

    The function is pure and performs no side effects.  Prices must be provided
    for each symbol and be strictly positive.  Weights are derived using the
    available equity after applying ``cash_buffer_pct`` to the USD cash balance
    and include a ``"CASH"`` entry representing the remaining USD cash.  Non-USD
    cash balances are excluded from weight normalisation.  Due to floating point
    rounding the weights may not sum exactly to ``1.0`` but are expected to be
    within ``Â±1e-6``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions:
        Mapping of symbol to quantity.  Zero quantities are rejected.
    prices:
        Mapping of symbol to last trade price.  Prices must be positive and not
        NaN.
    cash_balances:
        Mapping of currency code (e.g. ``"USD"``/``"CAD"``) to amount.
    cash_buffer_pct:
        Fraction of the USD cash balance to exclude from exposure/weight
        calculations.
