"""Trading safety helpers.

This module contains small utility functions that gate potentially dangerous
operations.  They are intentionally lightweight so that they can be used in
tests without pulling in heavy dependencies.  The functions raise
``RuntimeError`` when a safety condition is violated which keeps the surface
area small while still being easy to reason about in tests.
